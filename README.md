## 7/29/2015 AngularJS, MySQL, and RESTful API 

#### The sample is an example using one our current buyflow designs and rendering Plans/Products using AngularJS, MySQL, and RESTful API.

To access this new implementation you will need to:
* set up a local MySQL. products.sql included to help set up. I did in phpMyAdmin.

#### These are added dirs. and files to File Structure:

* /partials
* /buyflow.html



## 7/28/2015 DataBinding AngularJS - 

#### The sample is an example using one our current buyflow designs and rendering Plans/Products using DataBinding AngularJS on the front end. 

To access this new implementation you will need to:
* add the project you your localhost then point to ** index.html **

The front end design elements uses the standard JQuery and Bootstraps framework.
I've attached external JS files, controllers, to the results page that display products from the controller js file.

** The external Angular JS files: **
* controller/angular.min.js
* controller/app.js
* controller/controller.js

** Standard Assets **

** CSS **
* widgetassets/css/bootstrap.css
* widgetassets/css/base.css
* widgetassets/css/theme.css
* widgetassets/css/base-responsive.css
* widgetassets/css/fonts.css
* widgetassets/css/font-awesome.css
* widgetassets/css/animate.css

** JS **
* widgetassets/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
* widgetassets/js/bootstrap.js
* widgetassets/js/jquery.placeholder.min.js
* widgetassets/js/equalheights.js
* widgetassets/js/base.js

##### The example displays the simplicity of develepment of front end web pages in the area of current buyflows.
#####This method can also be used with the landing pages SEO CityData.
